# Bluetooth Sensor App

This is an Android App designed as part of a wireless digital stethoscope design research project at Trinity College.
This app can receive heart sound data from an electronic stethoscope via Bluetooth. The data can then be graphed,
analyzed, and stored for further analysis and ease of second opinion. It is intended as the rough draft of a mobile
tool that would help medical practitioners make more accurate diagnoses of heart murmurs and heart diseases. At this
point, it employs a simple algorithm that can detect the systole and diastole of a heart sound, but a more complex
heart murmur classification algorithm could be implemented in the future.
